<h2>Tutoring Tips</h2>
<ol><li>
You are not the pupil's teacher, you are their mentor and hopefully will become their friend, they are your equal
</li><li>
You need to make learning fun, much as you are helping the pupils, they are teenagers giving up their spare time for extra learning - make it worth it
</li><li>
Ask the pupil how much he/she understands about the topic in question before explaining anything
</li><li>
Ask the pupil what the teacher has explained and any areas that they find particularly difficult to understand. 
</li><li>
Explain each concept one at a time. 
</li><li>
Think of analogies to help explain difficult concepts 
</li><li>
Use images and the pupil's teaching materials to help explanations 
</li><li>
Check understanding of each part by testing the pupil with questions 
</li><li>
Assist remembering of the information by thinking of pneumonics, hand gestures, rhymes 
</li><li>
 Give the pupil homework - even if it is just a definition of terms discussed that day or verbal recall of concepts
