<p> grAID Higher is an organisation where university students tutor school pupils for free. grAID Higher aims to enhance the education of secondary school students of every age and ability. By using university students as tutors grAID Higher aspires to improve the grades of secondary school children and provide university students with the opportunity to learn invaluable transferable teaching skills. We also hope that this form of tutoring will be personally rewarding for the university students and will really help more secondary school students to be enthusiastic about university and gain more vital study skills. Overall, we hope that the cooperative collaboration between university and school students will reduce the gap that can exist between school and higher education.
